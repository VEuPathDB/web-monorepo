# NOTE: This workflow is largely legacy/redundant now that all workflows (including pr-check.yml)
# automatically cache dependencies. Since PR caches are accessible to the main branch and vice versa,
# this explicit pre-warming step is no longer strictly necessary.
#
# We're keeping it for now because:
# 1. It ensures main always has a "canonical" cache after yarn.lock changes
# 2. It provides explicit cache warming independent of PR activity
# 3. It has minimal overhead and doesn't cause problems
#
# This could be safely removed if desired - PRs will create caches that main can use.
