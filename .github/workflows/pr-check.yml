# Ensure that affected projects build without error for any pull request
#
# Note: We only run compile:check, which has dependsOn: ["^build-npm-modules"] configured
# in nx.json. This means NX automatically builds all dependencies before running the check.
# Any libraries that aren't dependencies of the site packages won't be built or checked.
