# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: This line must remain COMMENTED in git!
#
# For legacy deployment servers ONLY:
# Uncomment this line locally to use bundled Yarn 3.3.1 for end-of-life systems.
# DO NOT commit this change - the pre-commit hook will block it.
# Before git pull/checkout, restore with: git restore .yarnrc.yml

# Prevent accidental lockfile modifications - yarn.lock must be committed to git
# Commands like 'yarn add' and 'yarn remove' work normally, but plain 'yarn install'
# will fail if it would modify the lockfile. This prevents accidental mass upgrades
# (e.g., regenerating yarn.lock would upgrade many packages to newer versions).
# All dependency upgrades should be intentional and reviewed.
