# web-monorepo

## Prerequisties
* `Node <=16.17.1`
* A global installation of `yarn >=1.17.0`
** With such a version globally installed, all `yarn` commands executed in this repo will be delegated to the "pinned" `yarn@3.3.1` installation included in `.yarn/releases`

## Quick Start

### Install yarn dependencies

From anywhere in the repo:

```
yarn
```

### View workspace dependency graph

From the root `package.json`:

```
yarn nx graph
```

### Execute a workspace's yarn script using the `nx` task runner

From the root `package.json`:

```
yarn nx run <workspaceName>:<scriptName>
```

For example, you can start the MultiBLAST dev server by running

```
yarn nx run @veupathdb/multi-blast:start
```

## Notes on individual packages

### EDA dev server

Directory: `packages/libs/eda`

You will need to configure the server with a `packages/libs/eda/.env.local` file that sets various environment variables.

For more documentation see the link:packages/libs/eda/README.md[package README] and link:packages/libs/eda/.env.local.sample.localservices[this sample file].
