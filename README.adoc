= web-monorepo
These are instructions to work with the VEuPathDB UI either by executing a single workspace’s yarn script -using the nx task runner- (eg the mblast UI or the EDA UI), or by accessing the complete UI by starting a local site. In both cases a webpack server will be started and a new browser tab will be opened. The backend will be accessed via a remote site stated in your monorepo (packages/sites/*website) .env file.
:toc:

== Prerequisites
* `Node >=24.0.0`
* `corepack` enabled for Yarn version management
* Supply chain security environment variable (recommended)

=== Required Environment Variables for Development

Add this to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

[source, bash]
----
# Supply chain security: require packages to be 7+ days old (Yarn 4+ feature)
export YARN_NPM_MINIMAL_AGE_GATE=10080
----

*Why this is needed:*

- `YARN_NPM_MINIMAL_AGE_GATE=10080`: Protects against supply chain attacks by requiring NPM packages to be at least 7 days old before installation. This is a Yarn 4+ feature that helps prevent installing packages immediately after publication (when they're most vulnerable to compromise).

[NOTE]
====
*Developers have two options for setting this variable*

_Option A: Global shell configuration (simple)_

Add the variable to your shell profile (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.) as shown above. This will apply to all Yarn 4+ projects on your system.

_Option B: Per-repository with direnv (recommended)_

Use https://direnv.net/[direnv] to automatically set this variable only when working in this repository:

1. Install direnv for your platform (see https://direnv.net/docs/installation.html[installation instructions])

2. Add the direnv hook to your shell config:
+
[source, bash]
----
# For bash, add to ~/.bashrc:
eval "$(direnv hook bash)"

# For zsh, add to ~/.zshrc:
eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"

# For fish, add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:
direnv hook fish | source
----

3. Enable direnv in this repository:
+
[source, shell]
----
cp .envrc.example .envrc
direnv allow
----

The environment variable will now be set automatically whenever you enter this repository directory.
====

=== Setup with Volta (Recommended)

https://volta.sh/[Volta] is recommended for Node version management. It will automatically use Node 24 when working in this repository.

To set up Volta with Corepack:

[source, shell]
----
# Install volta if you haven't already
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash

# Install corepack globally and enable it with volta integration
npm install -g corepack
corepack enable --install-directory ~/.volta/bin
----

This configuration allows Volta to manage Node versions while Corepack manages Yarn versions based on the `packageManager` field in `package.json`.

=== Setup without Volta

If you're not using Volta, simply enable corepack:

[source, shell]
----
corepack enable
----

_Note: If you have a global `yarn` installation, you may need to uninstall it first to avoid conflicts with corepack._

=== Package Manager Verification

*IMPORTANT:* This project requires Yarn. Using `npm install` will fail with dependency resolution errors because this monorepo uses Yarn-specific features (workspace protocol, etc.) that npm doesn't support.

The repository includes automatic checks that run before `yarn install` to verify:

- Corepack is properly configured with the correct Yarn version (4.12.0)

If you see errors about wrong Yarn version, refer to the setup instructions above.

=== Legacy Deployment Environments

*WARNING*: This section is ONLY for legacy deployment servers that cannot upgrade to Node.js 24. Development machines should follow the standard Prerequisites above.

==== Dual-Mode Yarn Setup

This repository supports both modern (corepack-managed Yarn 4) and legacy (bundled Yarn 3) environments:

- *Development machines*: Use Yarn 4.12.0 via corepack (as specified in `package.json`)
- *Legacy deployment servers*: Use bundled Yarn 3.3.1 at `.yarn/releases/yarn-3.3.1.cjs`

==== Deployment on Legacy Systems

If you're deploying to an environment that cannot run Node.js 24 (such as end-of-life CentOS 7), set these environment variables:

On `palm` and other legacy servers, add these exports to `$BASE_GUS/etc/setenv` for persistence, then paste them into your current shell to activate immediately. _(Don't re-source `setenv` - it will duplicate `PATH` entries.)_

[source, bash]
----
# Bypass version checks for web-monorepo
export SKIP_YARN_VERSION_CHECK=true
export npm_config_engine_strict=false

# Allow lockfile modifications (Yarn 3/4 lockfile format incompatibility)
export YARN_ENABLE_IMMUTABLE_INSTALLS=false
----

==== Uncommenting yarnPath for Legacy Deployment

On legacy deployment servers, you must uncomment the yarnPath line in `.yarnrc.yml`:

[source, bash]
----
# Edit .yarnrc.yml and change:
# # yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.3.1.cjs
# to:
# yarnPath: .yarn/releases/yarn-3.3.1.cjs
----

This will make `yarn` commands use the bundled Yarn 3.3.1, even when called from Ant or other build tools. No need to call Yarn with a fully-qualified path.

*CRITICAL*:
- The uncommented `yarnPath` line in `.yarnrc.yml` must *NEVER* be committed to git. The pre-commit hook will prevent this. Before running `git pull` or `git checkout`, restore the file with `git restore .yarnrc.yml`.
- The `yarn.lock` file uses Yarn 4 format. When Yarn 3 runs `yarn install`, it will modify checksums in the lockfile. These changes are format-only (no package version changes) but must *NEVER* be committed to git, as they will break Yarn 4 on development machines. A hook should prevent this anyway. Before changing code with `git pull` or `git checkout`, restore the file with `git restore yarn.lock`.

*Security implications*:

- Legacy deployments do NOT benefit from the 7-day package age gate (Yarn 4+ feature)
- Only use this for deployment servers where you will NOT be running `yarn add` or installing new packages
- The security measures are designed to protect developer machines from supply chain attacks during package installation

==== Ant Build Workaround

The `YARN_ENABLE_IMMUTABLE_INSTALLS=false` environment variable does not override `yarn --frozen-lockfile` commands in Ant build scripts. To work around this:

*First-time setup after checkout:*

[source, bash]
----
cd web-monorepo
yarn  # This modifies yarn.lock to Yarn 3 format
# Verify: git status should show yarn.lock as modified
----

After this initial `yarn` run, subsequent Ant build commands (`rebuilder`, `wb site`, etc.) will succeed because the lockfile is already in the expected format.

*IMPORTANT*: Before running `git pull` or `git checkout`, restore the lockfile:
[source, bash]
----
git restore yarn.lock
----

After any git operation that changes the repository, run `yarn` again to re-modify the lockfile.

== Quick Start

=== Install yarn dependencies

From anywhere in the repo:

[source, shell]
----
yarn
----

*Note:* This repository uses immutable installs for security. The `yarn.lock` file must be committed to git and cannot be modified by `yarn install`. Commands like `yarn add <package>` and `yarn remove <package>` work normally and will update the lockfile as expected. This prevents accidental mass upgrades (e.g., deleting and regenerating yarn.lock would upgrade many packages to newer versions). All dependency upgrades should be intentional and reviewed.

== Overview

This repository is a "monorepo", using the https://nx.dev[nx] build system and https://yarnpkg.com/[yarn@4] dependency manager. The source code is divided into one of three types of packages: "config", "lib", and "site".

- "config" packages (`./packages/configs`) include various build and development configurations and tools.
- "lib" packages (`./packages/libs`) include standalone library and webapp source code.
- "site" packages (`./packages/sites`) include complete website source code.

Many "lib" and "site" packages include development tools, such as development servers, test scripts, etc.

Many commands require a reference to the package name. All package names are currently prefixed with `@veupathdb/`. For example, the eda package name is `@veupathdb/eda`.

The repository is currently configured as a "package based repository". This is subject to change, in the future (see https://nx.dev/concepts/integrated-vs-package-based to read about the differences between package based and integrated repos).
 
== Common Tasks

The following tasks are common performed by developers. This serves as a reference guide, and is not exhaustive in any way. If you feel something is missing, create an issue, or open a pull request.

_All commands are expected to be run in the repository's root directory, unless otherwise specified._

=== Start a local dev site

"Site" projects are stored in the `packages/sites` directory. Each one corresponds to a "cohort". For example, `packages/sites/genomics-site`
contains the code used to build the client code for a genomics website.

Each cohort contains a `.env.sample` file. Copy this to a sibling `.env` file. You may need to modify some values, such as usernames,
passwords, etc. You can also specify a website to use for various services. Typically a deployed QA site will suffice, but you can also run a "local backend" via various methods. (TODO: link to relevants docs/repos).

Once you have created a `.env` file, you can run the local dev site with the command:

[source, shell]
----
yarn nx start <package name>
----

For example, if you want to run a local clinepi site, you would run the command:

[source, shell]
----
yarn nx start @veupathdb/clinepi-site
----

Once the website has been compiled, the dev server will output some build statistics and automatically open a browser tab. You can kill the local dev server with `CTRL-C` in the terminal where you started it. 

=== Modifying code (and updating a running local dev site)

When a local dev site is running, it will detect when build dependencies are updated and reload the active webpage.

__Note: the following refers to code tracked by the monorepo, and not third-party dependencies from npm.__

There are two types of souce code that can be updated:

1. Source code within the package being served.
2. Source code within a dependent package.

Changes to code within the package being served will be detected automatically. The local dev service should reompile the affected module and reload the website without intervention.

Changes to code within a dependent workspace package will require a build command for the local dev server to detect the change.

For example, if you change code in `packages/libs/eda`, you will need to run this command in a new terminal window, from the repository root:

[source, shell]
----
yarn workspace @veupathdb/eda build-npm-modules
----

Once this command completed, the running dev server will see the updated build artifacts, recompile the website, and reload the webpage. There are some cases where this might not work as expected, such as if the recompile step fails. In those cases, you may need to restart the local dev server. You can monitor the progress of the recompilation step in the terminal where you started the dev server.

=== View workspace dependency graph

From the root `package.json`:

[source, shell]
----
yarn nx graph
----

=== Execute a workspace's yarn script using the `nx` task runner

From the root `package.json`:

[source, shell]
----
yarn nx run <workspaceName>:<scriptName>
----

For example, you can start the MultiBLAST dev server by running

[source, shell]
----
yarn nx run @veupathdb/multi-blast:start
----

=== Rebuild dependencies when running a development server

When running a development server (such as `yarn nx start @veupathdb/eda` or `yarn nx start @veupathdb/clinepi-site`),
use the following command to rebuild changes made to dependencies, and to have the dev site reload with the changes:

[source, shell]
----
cd packages/libs/<package>
yarn build-npm-modules
----

**Note: You may need to manually reload your website to see the changes the first time.**

_Using the equivalent `nx` command (`yarn nx build-npm-modules @veupathdb/<package>`) has proven inadequate in this scenario._

== Notes on individual packages

=== EDA dev server

Directory: `packages/libs/eda`

You will need to configure the server with a `packages/libs/eda/.env.local` file that sets various environment variables.

For more documentation see the link:packages/libs/eda/README.md[package README] and link:packages/libs/eda/.env.local.sample.localservices[this sample file].

=== VEuPathDB sites

Directory: `packages/sites/{site name}-site`

Copy the `packages/sites/{site name}-site/.env.sample` file to `packages/sites/{site name}-site/.env` and configure the new file with passwords and the desired backend for the site.

Run `yarn` to update dependencies if necessary.

Run the command `yarn nx start @veupathdb/{site name}-site`. For example, to run the ortho site use `yarn nx start @veupathdb/ortho-site`.

== IDE hints

=== emacs tide

If it is showing errors for tsx imports (especially in `eda`) and
`tide-verify-setup` mentions tsserver version 3.x then it is time to
upgrade emacs tide (to, at time of writing 4.5.4):

[source]
----
M-x package-reinstall <ret> tide <ret>
----

== Client Bundle Server 🐉

**Warning. There be dragons! This section has not been maintained for a long time.**

The Client Bundle Server is a Docker image based on NGINX that is used to serve
VEuPathDB client code over HTTP.

As the client code comes in 2 flavors (bundles), legacy and modern, this NGINX
server has an internal path rewrite based on the requesting browser's user agent
string to the appropriate client bundle component on request.

This means using a modern browser, requesting the file
`genomics/site-client.bundle.js` will cause the server to actually return
`modern/genomics/site-client.bundle.js` whereas requesting that same file from
an older or unsupported browser (such as CURL or Postman) the server will return
`legacy/genomics/site-client.bundle.js`.

=== Browsers

Whether a browser is considered modern or legacy is dependent on the version of
the browser compared to a RegEx constructed by the
link:https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp[browserslist-useragent-regexp]
library using the input query constructed in the
link:packages/configs/browserslist-config[browserslist-config] package of
this repo.  (See link:packages/configs/browserslist-config/index.js[index.js]
for the raw queries)

=== Docker Image

The docker image is based on NGINX-Perl and includes NodeJS for executing a
script based on
link:https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist-useragent-regexp[browserslist-useragent-regexp]
that determines which path a specified file should be served from.

The image build is multi-staged with the first stage compiling primary contents
of this repository, and the second stage setting up NGINX and the secondary JS
script included in the link:docker/[docker] directory
(link:docker/makeSupportedBrowsersScript.js[makeSupportedBrowsersScript.js]).

=== Paths

Content is served from the following paths from the root path used to reach a
running instance of the built Docker image:

[source]
----
{URL}/clinepi/{target-file}
{URL}/genomics/{target-file}
{URL}/mbio/{target-file}
{URL}/ortho/{target-file}
----

These paths correspond to the following container internal paths:

[source]
----
/var/www/legacy/clinepi/{target-file}
/var/www/modern/clinepi/{target-file}

/var/www/legacy/genomics/{target-file}
/var/www/modern/genomics/{target-file}

/var/www/legacy/mbio/{target-file}
/var/www/modern/mbio/{target-file}

/var/www/legacy/ortho/{target-file}
/var/www/modern/ortho/{target-file}
----

=== Testing

The Docker image may be tested locally by performing the following steps from
the link:docker/[docker/] subdirectory:

. Build and Start the image:
+
[source, shell]
----
make docker-build
make docker-run
----

. Using your favorite HTTP request making tool such as Postman, CURL, or a web
browser, make a request to
http://localhost/genomics/site-client.bundle.js.LICENSE.txt . If the service is
working you should receive a LICENSE text file's contents as the response with
a 200 status code.  If it is not working you will receive a 403 or 404 error.
