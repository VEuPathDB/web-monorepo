# Color Palettes

Color is an important part of creating a pleasant and engagement UI/UX. In order to help developers
find just the right color for their needs, we have developed the following color palettes.

The goal here to provide a wide variety of options, while also helping promote visual consistency
across our websites through carefully chosen saturation and lightness variations for each available color hue.

## Neutral Colors
