However, transmission is endemic in 21 of 25 provinces and it is estimated that 58% of the population, or approximately 8.6 million people, continue to live in malaria at-risk areas. The incidence of clinical cases is highest in the north-eastern part of the country, with the highest risk in forest or forest fringe areas of the country, usually found along the borders.

GEMS1 aimed to elucidate the more clinically severe medically-attended diarrheal episodes to guide and prioritize efforts to prevent the most life-threatening and disabling illnesses. It is also important to characterize the \"less severe\" diarrhea (LSD) episodes for which care is sought at health care facilities, recognizing that even though there may be fewer adverse health consequences from these illnesses, the overall LSD burden could be greater because it is more common than \"moderate-to-severe\" diarrhea (MSD). Whether there are meaningful differences in the distribution of etiologies of LSD compared with MSD also must be understood to optimize diarrheal disease prevention and treatment. Therefore a one-year follow-on study designated GEMS-1A was conducted in which six GEMS sites performed simultaneous case-control studies of both MSD and LSD, and one GEMS site performed a case-control study of MSD only. At the time of these studies, no site had introduced rotavirus vaccine into its Expanded Program on Immunization for young infants.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The objective of GEMS-1A was to determine whether the findings of GEMS were generalizable to episodes of less-severe diarrhoea (LSD), which represent the majority of paediatric diarrhea in patients presenting to health-care centres.

Omnivore and vegan, but not EEN, diets altered fecal amino acid levels by supporting the growth of Firmicutes capable of amino acid metabolism. This correlated with relative abundance of a sizable number of fecal amino acid metabolites, some not previously associated with the gut microbiota.

      "description": "The composition of the maternal vaginal microbiome influences the duration of pregnancy, onset of labor, and even neonatal outcomes. Maternal microbiome research in sub-Saharan Africa has focused on non-pregnant and postpartum composition of the vaginal microbiome. This study examines the relationship between the vaginal microbiome of 99 laboring Ugandan women and intrapartum fever using routine microbiology and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing from two hypervariable regions (V1–V2 and V3–V4). To describe the vaginal microbes associated with vaginal microbial communities, two approaches were taken: hierarchical clustering methods and a novel Grades of Membership (GoM) modeling approach for vaginal microbiome characterization. Leveraging GoM models, a basis was created which was comprised of a preassigned number of microbial topics whose linear combination optimally represents each patient yielding more comprehensive associations and characterization between maternal clinical features and the microbial communities. Using a random forest model, it was showed that by including microbial topic models there was improved ability to use clinical variables to predict maternal fever. Overall, a higher prevalence of Granulicatella, Streptococcus, Fusobacterium, Anaerococcus, Sneathia, Clostridium, Gemella, Mobiluncus, and Veillonella genera was observed in febrile mothers, and higher prevalence of Lactobacillus genera (in particular L. crispatus and L. jensenii), Acinobacter, Aerococcus, and Prevotella species in afebrile mothers. By including clinical variables with microbial topics in this model, it was observed that young maternal age, fever reported earlier in the pregnancy, longer labor duration, and microbial communities with reduced Lactobacillus diversity were associated with intrapartum fever. These results better defined relationships between the presence or absence of intrapartum fever, demographics, peripartum course, and vaginal microbial topics, and expanded our understanding of the impact of the microbiome on maternal and potentially neonatal outcome risk.",

The primary mechanism is likely via reduction in infectious burden. Antibiotics have growth-promoting effects in children with recognized clinical illness such as HIV, and have been shown to reduce mortality in some settings in children with severe acute malnutrition. Antibiotics may lead to increased weight gain via reduction in clinical and subclinical infections, through reducing inflammation, or through alteration of gut microbiome. Azithromycin may affect growth and nutrition outcomes via such pathways, contributing to overall observed reductions in mortality. In lower resource settings, previous randomized controlled trials have demonstrated evidence of increased weight gain following antibiotic administration in children with acute illness. \n      <p />\n      Studies of mass distribution of azithromycin for trachoma control have evaluated the effect of azithromycin distributed to entire communities on anthropometric measurements in children. These studies have not shown evidence that mass azithromycin distribution or increased frequency of mass azithromycin distribution significantly affects indicators of nutritional status including stunting, underweight, and wasting. However, these studies randomized entire communities to different azithromycin distribution strategies or to no azithromycin distribution and were therefore limited by the number of clusters randomized and by lack of longitudinal measurements. To address this knowledge gap, an individually randomized trial was conducted to assess whether single dose azithromycin treatment causes weight gain in a general population sample of children in Burkina Faso.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> GAMIN is an individually randomized trial designed to assess potential mechanisms for any effect of azithromycin on childhood mortality, including alterations in the pediatric microbiome and infections.

      "description": "Enteric parasitic infections are among the most prevalent infections in the developing world, and have a profound impact on global public health.  While the microbiome is increasingly recognized as a key determinant of gut health and human development, the impact of natural parasite infections on the microbial community in the gut is poorly understood.  There are several challenges to studying parasite-microbiome interactions in a human population, including frequent administration of anti-parasitic treatments, malnourishment, and low prevalence of these infections in developed countries.  In contrast, enteric parasites are routinely identified in annual screens of domestic dogs and cats in the United States, presenting a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of naturally-acquired parasite infections on the microbiome.  Giardia, for example, is among the most prevalent parasites in domestic dogs and cats. Here, we investigated the impact of eukaryotic parasite infection on the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome in a cohort of 270 dogs. Fecal samples of uninfected dogs (43%), dogs infected with a single parasite (48%), and dogs infected with multiple parasites (9%), were obtained from patients at the University of Pennsylvania’s Ryan Veterinary Hospital. The V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was sequenced at an average depth of 45,000 reads per sample. We observed a significant correlation between parasite infection and beta diversity consistent with the hypothesis that enteric parasites perturb the composition of the bacterial microbiome.  We also observed that, relative to other types of enteric pathogens observed in our dataset, Giardia was associated with a more pronounced perturbation of the microbiome.  Finally, we use publicly available data from large-scale human field studies of enteric diseases to compare and contrast parasite-induced alterations in the microbiome across host species.",

However, metagenomic data in these populations remains scarce and the association with soil-transmitted helminth infection status is unclear. Here, we sequenced 650 metagenomes of indigenous Malaysians from 5 villages with different prevalence of helminth infections. Individuals from villages with higher prevalence of helminth infections have more unmapped reads and greater microbial diversity. Microbial community diversity and composition were most strongly associated with different villages and the effects of helminth infection status on the microbiome varies by village. Longitudinal changes in the microbiome in response to albendazole anthelmintic treatment was observed in both helminth infected and uninfected individuals. Inference of bacterial population replication rates from origin of replication analysis identified specific replicating taxa associated with helminth infection. Our results indicated that helminth effects on the microbiota was highly dependent on context and effects of albendazole on the microbiota can be confounding for the interpretation of deworming studies. Furthermore, a substantial quantity of the microbiome remains undescribed and this large dataset from indigenous populations associated with helminth infections should facilitate characterization of the disappearing microbiome from developed industrialized societies.",

The Zanzibar archipelago of the United Republic of Tanzania, with the main islands Pemba and Unguja, has a history of schistosomiasis control that dates back to the 1980s. At that time, urogenital schistosomiasis caused by <i>S. haematobium</i>, was highly prevalent across both islands. Thirty years later, considerable progress had been made and the Zanzibar islands were one of the first areas in sub-Saharan Africa where elimination of urogenital schistosomiasis was considered as a feasible goal. \n      <p />\n      The Zanzibar Elimination of Schistosomiasis Transmission (ZEST) alliance, consisting of various stakeholders and institutions, aimed to eliminate schistosomiasis as a public health problem from Pemba (<1% heavy infection intensities in all sentinel sites) and to interrupt transmission on Unguja (zero incidence in all sentinel sites) in 5 years.

To address the persistently high rates of malaria in these remote regions, the Odisha State Malaria Control Program introduced 'malaria camps' in 2017 where teams of health workers visit villages to educate the population, enhance vector control methods, and perform village-wide screening and treatment. Malaria rates declined statewide, particularly in the forested areas, following the introduction of the malaria camps, but the impact of the intervention is yet to be externally evaluated. This cluster-assigned quasi-experimental stepped-wedge phase 1 study with a pretest-posttest control group was designed to evaluate if the malaria camps reduce the prevalence of malaria, compared to control villages which receive the usual malaria control interventions (e.g., IRS, ITNs), as detected by PCR.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> To determine if malaria camps reduce malaria prevalence as detected by PCR (primary) and RDT (secondary). Additional secondary objectives include determining if malaria camps reduce the prevalence of subpatent, symptomatic, and asymptomatic malaria; assessing malaria exposure among participants in each arm of the study through high-throughput detection of antibodies; determining the out-of-pockets costs and impact of malaria from both the patient and program perspectives; and building research capacity in Odisha and India to help train the next generation of malaria and mosquito vector biologists.\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> Keonjhar and Jharsuguda Districts, Odisha, India\n      <p />\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> August 2019 to November 2020\n      <p />\n      <b>Study Design:</b> Cluster-assigned, quasi-experimental study, with baseline and three follow-up surveys\n      <p />\n      <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> Study villages were selected based on high malaria prevalence and no prior exposure to the intervention being administered under the guidance of the Odisha state malaria control program officials.

Although there have been reductions in mortality in recent decades, there is substantial room for improvement. Despite a dramatic shift from home to facility-based births, birth attendants often do not adhere to practices known to reduce mortality, and mortality has not decreased as expected. Research has shown that interventions incorporating job aids, such as checklists or case sheets, and direct, in-person support have proved effective in improving clinical practices and outcomes. To bridge the gap between evidence and practice, the World Health Organization (WHO) created the Safe Childbirth Checklist, a practical tool to assist birth attendants in planning for and performing a more complete bundle of 28 essential birth practices related to the most common causes of avoidable death for women and newborns.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The primary objective of the study was to improve adoption and sustained use of the World Health Organization Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC), an organized collection of 28 essential birth practices that are known to improve the quality of facility-based childbirth care.\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b> \n      <blockquote>\n        <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> 60 pairs of healthcare facilities across 24 districts of Uttar Pradesh, India\n        <p />\n        <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> 2014 - 2016\n        <p />\n        <b>Study Design:</b> Matched-pair cluster randomized trial\n        <p />\n        <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> A facility was eligible if it was designated as a primary health center, community health center, or first referral unit; had at least 1000 deliveries annually; had at least three birth attendants with training of at least the level of an auxiliary nurse midwife; had no other concurrent quality-improvement or research programs; and had district and facility leadership willing to participate.\n        <p />\n        <b>Randomization:</b> Facilities (i.e., clusters) were matched on the basis of the following criteria before randomization: geographic zone, functional classification (primary health center, community health center, or first referral unit), distance to a district hospital, annual birth volume, and number of birth attendants.

However, even when additional clinical symptoms are collected for diagnosis and treatment, those symptoms are often nonspecific. Delays or inaccuracies in arriving at a clinical diagnosis can lead to inappropriate treatment that may result in fatalities.

This field and laboratory assay detects parasite eggs to estimate prevalence and intensity of infection and ultimately determines the treatment strategy of a program. The KK test requires the collection of stool and, although considered highly specific, is known to be relatively insensitive, especially in areas with low prevalence and intensity. Recently, the development and evaluation of a urine-based, field-friendly, point of contact (POC) assay that detects worm-produced circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) has shown to be relatively specific and highly sensitive across endemic settings, although there have been difficulties in interpreting the so-called trace results lying between clearly negative and clearly positive. Point-of-care circulating cathodic antigen (POC-CCA) is particularly valuable for national programs to evaluate the burden of <i>S. mansoni</i> where regular preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel has been ongoing and there is, consequently, lower endemicity and where program goals may change to elimination as a public health problem.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> A national school-based reassessment was carried out, using both KK for the detection of <i>S. mansoni</i> eggs and POC-CCA for detection of the worm antigen to determine the feasibility of moving toward schistosomiasis elimination in Rwanda.\n      <p />\n      The study had the following scientific objectives:\n      <ul>\n      <li>Present the results from the 2014 POC-CCA mapping of 388 schools in Rwanda</li>\n      <li>Compare the POC-CCA and KK results in 175 schools evaluated by both tests</li>\n      </ul>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> This study was conducted throughout Rwanda.\n      <p />\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> June 2014 to mid-July 2014\n      <p />\n      <b>Study Design:</b> Country-wide cross-sectional survey\n      <p />\n      <b>Sampling:</b> A multistage, cross-sectional, cluster-randomized survey was undertaken to estimate prevalence within independent mapping units.

Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of schistosomiasis control.\n     <p />\n     The Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) project conducted multi-year, randomized intervention trials that assessed changes in prevalence and intensity of schistosomiasis in children aged 9-12 years in villages receiving MDA using different strategies over a 4-year intervention period. These longitudinal studies also provided an opportunity to explore the impact of MDA on schistosomiasis-associated morbidity in children. Morbidity associated with <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> is caused by parasite eggs that are deposited daily into the human host's organs, creating thousands of foci of granulomatous inflammation, particularly in the bowel and liver. These granulomas can cause critical dysfunction of the affected organs, and the granuloma's chronic inflammation contributes to multiple systemic deficits, including chronic pain, diarrhea, anemia and reduced quality of life.\n     <p />\n     <b>Objectives:</b> The objectives of this nested cohort study were to describe changes in anthropometric growth indices, hemoglobin levels, measures of physical fitness, and quality of life, as well as the liver abnormalities and portal vein findings among study cohort children (aged 7-8 years at baseline) at the end of their 4-year study participation. \n     <p />\n     The study hypothesis was that annual community-wide treatment with praziquantel could provide incremental health benefits in terms of reductions in observed morbidity when compared with the effects of a less intensive regimen, that is, every-other-year treatment administered in a school-based program.\n     <p />\n     <b>Methodology</b>\n     <blockquote>\n     <b>Study Sites:</b> The cohort studies were conducted in the SCORE intervention trial regions of Kenya and Tanzania with high prevalence (>25%) of <i>S. mansoni</i> infection.\n     <p />\n     <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> 2011- 2015\n     <p />\n     <b>Study Design:</b> Cohort study; morbidity in the selected cohort was evaluated serially at baseline, and after 3 and 5 years.\n     <p/>\n     <b>Data Collection:</b> \n     <ul>\n     <li><b>Selection of villages</b>: The large intervention trials in which the cohorts were nested include 25 villages per arm.

It is a major public health problem in Mozambique. An epidemiological survey between 2005 and 2007 showed that the mean estimated prevalence of urogenital schistosomiasis, <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i>, was 47% while that of intestinal schistosomiasis, <i>S. mansoni</i>, was much lower ( about 1%) across all of Mozambique. In Cabo Delgado province, the area where this study took place, the prevalence of <i>S. haematobium</i> was 57.9%, ranging from 8.8% on the coast to 93% inland.\n      <p />\n      Mass drug administration (MDA) with the drug praziquantel is the mainstay of global schistosomiasis control. The Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) was established in 2008 to answer strategic questions about schistosomiasis control. Existing thresholds for implementation of mass treatment for schistosomiasis needed refinement and a better evidence base to establish the relative benefits of different age-group coverage formats and different schedules of targeted mass praziquantel delivery. There was interest in finding out whether, when compared with school-based treatment, using one or more years of community-wide treatment would have a greater impact on the prevalence and intensity of infection if, for example, community-wide treatment could achieve better coverage of school-aged children who did not attend school or better coverage of high-risk adults. There also was a lack of data as to whether every-other-year delivery of MDA could be sufficient for morbidity control. \n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The primary research question of this study is which strategy for MDA provided the greatest reduction in prevalence and intensity of <i>S. haematobium</i> infection among 9-to-12-year olds after four years of intervention in Cabo Delgado, Northern Mozambique. In addition, the impact of treatment on first-year students and adults sampled in each village was also assessed. These findings were designed to provide an evidence base for the Mozambique national control programme for schistosomiasis to address strategic questions about schistosomiasis treatment and potentially shift from morbidity control to interruption of transmission, and subsequently elimination.\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Study Sites:</b> This study was conducted in 150 villages in 10 out of 17 districts of Mozambique's northernmost province, Cabo Delgado.

      "description": "<b>Background:</b> Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been shown to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality across a range of epidemiological settings, and the scale-up of nets is estimated to have been responsible for 69% of P. falciparum cases averted in Africa between 2000 and 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal coverage of populations at risk, defined as one net for every two people to achieve community benefits. \n      <p />\n      In Uganda, LLINs are the primary vector control intervention, and considerable  effort has been made to achieve universal coverage. However, to date, LLINs have not had the desired impact on malaria burden in Uganda. High levels of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors may be contributing to the limited impact of LLINs. \n      <p />\n      All LLINs are currently treated with pyrethroid insecticides due to their favorable safety profile at low doses, repellent effects, and rapid killing. However, pyrethroid resistance has been reported across Africa and could threaten malaria control. Unpublished data suggests that pyrethroid resistance is widespread across Uganda.\n      <p />\n      The threat of pyrethroid resistance has generated interest in combining more than one insecticide mixture in LLINs. One approach is to combine a pyrethroid insecticide with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which is capable of inhibiting cytochrome P450s, to potentially overcome pyrethroid resistance in anopheline vectors. \n      <p />\n      LLINs that include PBO are anticipated to be more effective in areas where pyrethroid resistance is mediated by P450s. However, the impact of PBO LLINs is expected to vary according to the bioavailability and retention of PBO, and the level, intensity, and mechanisms of insecticide resistance for local vectors, as well as across different transmission settings.\n      <p />\n      Evidence of the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO) is urgently needed. The Uganda National Malaria Control Program and implementing partners carried out a universal LLIN campaign in 2016-17, supported by generous contributions from international donors, including The Against Malaria Foundation, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the US President's Malaria Initiative, The AIDS Support Organisation, and the UK's Department for International Development. LLINs were distributed at no cost to all Ugandan households through a mass-distribution campaign. LLINs with, and without, PBO were distributed, presenting an opportunity to rigorously evaluate and compare the performance of combination LLINs (with PBO) and conventional LLINs (without PBO) on a wide-scale across a variety of malaria transmission intensities, vector ecologies, and insecticide resistance patterns. Following WHO guidance for robust evaluation of PBO nets, a cluster-randomized trial was carried out to compare the impact of LLINs with, and without, PBO in Uganda.\n      <br />\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The goal of the LLINEUP trial was to evaluate the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO), as compared to conventional LLINs (without PBO), on parasite prevalence, in Eastern and Western Uganda.\n      <p />\n      <b>Primary scientific objective:</b>\n      <p /> \n      The trial tested the hypothesis that parasite prevalence will be lower in intervention clusters (health sub-districts randomized to receive PBO nets), than in control clusters (health sub-districts randomized to conventional nets) overall, and stratified by region (Eastern and Western regions).\n      <p />\n      <b>Secondary scientific objectives:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of PermaNet 3.0 (with PBO), as compared to PermaNet 2.0 (without PBO), on parasite prevalence.</li>\n        <li>To evaluate the impact of Olyset Plus (with PBO), as compared to Olyset Net (without PBO), on parasite prevalence.</li>\n        <li>To determine factors associated with effectiveness of L",

To quantify potential microbial exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 159 humans and 36 dogs across 60 families consisting of spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither. Members of the same family, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than did individuals from different households, with an especially strong effect of co-habitation on skin compared to oral or fecal microbiota. Dog ownership, but not children, had a significant effect on the extent to which cohabiting adults shared skin (forehead and palm) microbiota, and dog-owning adults shared more microbial taxa with each other than with those who did not. Furthermore, adults shared more skin microbiota with their own dogs than with other dogs.

Importantly, this dysbiosis is not limited to the lesion site, but is transmissible to normal skin distant from the infection site and to skin from co-housed naive mice. This observation allowed us to test whether a pre-existing dysbiotic skin microbiota influences disease, and we found that challenging dysbiotic naive mice with L. major or testing for contact hypersensitivity results in exacerbated skin inflammatory responses. These findings demonstrate that a dysbiotic skin microbiota is not only a consequence of tissue stress, but also enhances inflammation, which has implications for many inflammatory cutaneous diseases.",

      "description": "<b>Background:</b> Long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been shown to reduce malaria morbidity and mortality across a range of epidemiological settings, and the scale-up of nets is estimated to have been responsible for 69% of P. falciparum cases averted in Africa between 2000 and 2015. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal coverage of populations at risk, defined as one net for every two people to achieve community benefits. \n      <p />\n      In Uganda, LLINs are the primary vector control intervention, and considerable  effort has been made to achieve universal coverage. However, to date, LLINs have not had the desired impact on malaria burden in Uganda. High levels of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors may be contributing to the limited impact of LLINs. \n      <p />\n      All LLINs are currently treated with pyrethroid insecticides due to their favorable safety profile at low doses, repellent effects, and rapid killing. However, pyrethroid resistance has been reported across Africa and could threaten malaria control. Unpublished data suggests that pyrethroid resistance is widespread across Uganda.\n      <p />\n      The threat of pyrethroid resistance has generated interest in combining more than one insecticide mixture in LLINs. One approach is to combine a pyrethroid insecticide with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which is capable of inhibiting cytochrome P450s, to potentially overcome pyrethroid resistance in anopheline vectors. \n      <p />\n      LLINs that include PBO are anticipated to be more effective in areas where pyrethroid resistance is mediated by P450s. However, the impact of PBO LLINs is expected to vary according to the bioavailability and retention of PBO, and the level, intensity, and mechanisms of insecticide resistance for local vectors, as well as across different transmission settings.\n      <p />\n      Evidence of the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO) is urgently needed. The Uganda National Malaria Control Program and implementing partners carried out a universal LLIN campaign in 2016-17, supported by generous contributions from international donors, including The Against Malaria Foundation, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the US President's Malaria Initiative, The AIDS Support Organisation, and the UK's Department for International Development.

In this study, children were enrolled within 17 days of birth and followed for 24 months (n = 271). For surveillance of asymptomatic enteric infections, children contributed fecal samples, and weight and length were measured monthly.  Fieldworkers visited homes twice-weekly to record histories of illness, antibiotic use, breastfeeding, and dietary intake; additional specimens were collected during diarrheal episodes.  Routine fecal samples obtained at postnatal months 6, 12, 18, and 24 were retrospectively selected for profiling of gut bacterial community composition.  In total, 146 boys and 125 girls contributed 6096 months of observations, 6011 surveillance fecal samples, and 2440 diarrheal samples to the study.  Diarrhea was defined as ≥3 loose stools in a 24-hour period, with distinct episodes separated by 2 diarrhea-free days.  Severity was measured using a community diarrheal assessment tool [PMID: 24907244].  Asymptomatic infection was defined as detection of pathogens in surveillance stools in the absence of diarrhea or fever, and “pathogen pressure” was calculated as the mean number of enteropathogens per stool. Standard anthropometric and breastfeeding categories were based on World Health Organization (WHO) definitions [NCBI bookshelf ID: NBK148959; and PMID: 16817681] and frequency of exposure to breastmilk was calculated as the cumulative mean number of feeds in the previous 24-hour period.

Kenya has made considerable progress in its HIV response, but HIV prevalence remains high in certain geographic pockets, among key populations (female sex workers - FSW, and men who have sex with men - MSM), and among certain vulnerable groups such as adolescent girls and young women (AGYW). Substantial work is needed to lower HIV transmission rates among these groups, who have higher prevalence and lower ART use compared to the general population. \n      <p />\n      The utility of PrEP has expanded to high-risk individuals not identified as key populations or individuals in sero-discordant relationships. Kenya, through the 2017 PrEP Implementation Framework recognized the need to offer PrEP for any willing individual perceived to be at a \"substantial risk\", thus tactfully framing it as a public health intervention and preventing stigmatization. Programs implementing scale up in Kenya and other nations in sub-Saharan Africa therefore anticipate unsolicited demand for PrEP and have been morally obligated to offer the intervention to all those requesting for it even when they are not part of their target populations.\n      <p />\n      The Jilinde project is serving as a \"learning laboratory,\" which informs as well as evaluates programmatic decisions, and is facilitating iterative explorations of different models of PrEP implementation at scale to fit a real-market, low-resource context.

      "description": "The DIABIMMUNE project aims to test the hygiene hypothesis and explore its role in the development of type 1 diabetes and other autoimmune diseases. Project researchers are seeking to validate the hypothesis and, in the process, uncover the biological mechanisms through which hygiene influences the immune system and potentially hampers the immune responses. This web site contains information about microbiome analyses conducted for DIABIMMUNE by researchers based at the Broad Institute. Previous studies have shown that a strong association exists between the prevalence of immune-mediated disease and improved standard of living and hygiene. The “hygiene hypothesis” is a widely supported theory that accounts for this observed association between the increase in diseases of the immune system and decreased exposure to pathogens. Initially, the hygiene hypothesis referred only to the increased incidence of allergy and asthma in developed countries, but in recent years it has been applied to the increased incidence of autoimmune diseases, such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) as well.The DIABIMMUNE project is looking at the microbiome in subjects from three separate countries – Russia, Finland, and Estonia – in order to explore this phenomenon. One of the starkest contrasts in standard of living worldwide is present at the border between Russian Karelia and Finland, where there is a sevenfold difference in the gross national product. Meanwhile, Estonia represents a country in rapid transition, having westernized since breaking away from the USSR over twenty years ago. These three populations comprise a “living laboratory,” offering a unique opportunity to test the hygiene hypothesis and gene-environmental interactions in the development of autoimmune disease. While there is little difference in the frequency of the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) genotypes that predispose individuals to and protect them from T1D between these countries, the incidence of T1D is six times lower in Russian Karelia than in Finland. The aim of the DIABIMMUNE project is to assess the role of the hygiene hypothesis in the development of immune-mediated diseases – T1D in particular – and to define the mechanisms behind the potential protective effect conferred by microbial agents. A part of the study follows 76 children from all the three countries. In this application, funding for the travel expenses to collaborate in this study by conducting statistical and computational modeling for this data is applied.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends universal coverage of populations at risk, defined as one net for every two people to achieve community benefits. \n      <p />\n      In Uganda, LLINs are the primary vector control intervention, and considerable  effort has been made to achieve universal coverage. However, to date, LLINs have not had the desired impact on malaria burden in Uganda. High levels of pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors may be contributing to the limited impact of LLINs. \n      <p />\n      All LLINs are currently treated with pyrethroid insecticides due to their favorable safety profile at low doses, repellent effects, and rapid killing. However, pyrethroid resistance has been reported across Africa and could threaten malaria control. Unpublished data suggests that pyrethroid resistance is widespread across Uganda.\n      <p />\n      The threat of pyrethroid resistance has generated interest in combining more than one insecticide mixture in LLINs. One approach is to combine a pyrethroid insecticide with a synergist, piperonyl butoxide (PBO), which is capable of inhibiting cytochrome P450s, to potentially overcome pyrethroid resistance in anopheline vectors. \n      <p />\n      LLINs that include PBO are anticipated to be more effective in areas where pyrethroid resistance is mediated by P450s. However, the impact of PBO LLINs is expected to vary according to the bioavailability and retention of PBO, and the level, intensity, and mechanisms of insecticide resistance for local vectors, as well as across different transmission settings.\n      <p />\n      Evidence of the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO) is urgently needed. The Uganda National Malaria Control Program and implementing partners carried out a universal LLIN campaign in 2016-17, supported by generous contributions from international donors, including The Against Malaria Foundation, The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the US President's Malaria Initiative, The AIDS Support Organisation, and the UK's Department for International Development. LLINs were distributed at no cost to all Ugandan households through a mass-distribution campaign. LLINs with, and without, PBO were distributed, presenting an opportunity to rigorously evaluate and compare the performance of combination LLINs (with PBO) and conventional LLINs (without PBO) on a wide-scale across a variety of malaria transmission intensities, vector ecologies, and insecticide resistance patterns. Following WHO guidance for robust evaluation of PBO nets, a cluster-randomized trial wascarried out to compare the impact of LLINs with, and without, PBO in Uganda.\n      <br />\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> OLD TEXT FROM LLINEUP: The goal of the LLINEUP trial was to evaluate the impact of combination LLINs (with PBO), as compared to conventional LLINs (without PBO), on parasite prevalence, in Eastern and Western Uganda.\n      <p />\n      <b>Primary objective:</b> The trial tested the hypothesis that parasite prevalence will be lower in intervention clusters (health sub-districts randomized to receive PBO nets), than in control clusters (health sub-districts randomized to conventional nets) overall, and stratified by region (Eastern and Western regions).\n      <p />\n      <b>Secondary objectives:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <ul>\n        <li> To evaluate the impact of PermaNet 3.0 (with PBO), as compared to PermaNet 2.0 (without PBO), on parasite p",

In 2016, the Kenya Ministry of Health, following the guidance of the WHO, revised the national &#34;Guidelines on Use of Antiretroviral Drugs for Treatment and Prevention of HIV Infection &#34; (NASCOP, 2016), and recommended the provision of PrEP to all individuals at substantial ongoing risk of acquiring HIV infection. Subsequently, the government launched a national PrEP scale-up program in May 2017. \n      <p />\n      However, as the government of Kenya continues to scale up PrEP, there is limited knowledge on the cost of scaling up the use of oral PrEP among Key and Vulnerable Populations (KVPs). The Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project commenced in July 2016 with an overall objective of supporting the government of Kenya to scale-up oral PrEP across the country. Jilinde conducted this study to assess the cost of PrEP for various KVPs using various models of service delivery and geographic regions of Kenya.\n      <p />\n      In this study we estimated the cost of PrEP from two different perspectives: the service delivery perspective and the client perspective. The service delivery perspective involved collecting cost data from health facility managers and by type of service delivery model (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, public health facilities that have integrated PrEP into the existing services and private clinics or social franchise clinics). This was to enable an analysis of the average unit cost of PrEP, as well as an analysis of the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya &#39;s existing prevention strategy among KVPs. The output of the activity is an estimate of cost per person year (PPY) of service delivery. The second perspective involved measuring costs borne by the clients (financial and opportunity costs). By understanding what costs are incurred by the clients, it is then possible to better understand if these costs represent a significant barrier to PrEP uptake. \n      <p />\n      In addition, the costing study also examined the client willingness to pay for oral PrEP services (medications, laboratory procedures, etc.). This contingent valuation analysis was critical in not only understanding how much clients are willing to pay, but also to better understand the factors that cause clients to have greater or lesser motivation to seek out these services. \n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The aim of the study was to estimate the full cost and unit cost of the PrEP scale-up program for different KVPs in Kenya. <p />\n        Specific objectives:  <p />\n        <ol>\n        <li style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\"> To determine the current unit costs of providing PrEP by mode of service delivery (drop in service centres, youth friendly centres, private sector and social franchise clinics and public health facilities) for various KVPs and geographic regions of Kenya;</li>\n        <li style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\">To estimate direct costs incurred by clients (financial and opportunity costs) in accessing PrEP; </li>\n        <li style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\">To analyze the incremental costs associated with adding PrEP to Kenya&#39;s existing prevention strategy among KVPs; </li>\n        <li style=\"list-style-type:decimal;\">To determine willingness to pay for PrEP services.</li>\n        </ol>\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> Data was collected from ten counties in Kenya where the Jilinde (Bridge to Scale) project was implemented.

      "description": "Development of the preterm infant gut microbiome has emerged as an important factor in health and disease. Since preterm infants almost universally receive early and often extended antibiotic therapy, it is important to understand how these interventions alter gut microbiota development. In this study, the authors carried out 'shotgun' metagenomic profiling of 401 stools from 84 longitudinally sampled preterm infants.  This was complemented by 16S rRNA marker gene sequencing carried out on a subset that included 124 of these stool samples from 36 infants.  Their findings show that meropenem, cefotaxime and ticarcillin-clavulanate are associated with significantly reduced species richness. In contrast, vancomycin and gentamicin, the antibiotics most commonly administered to preterm infants, have non-uniform effects on species richness, but these can be predicted with 85% accuracy based on the relative abundance of only two bacterial species and two antibiotic resistance (AR) genes at treatment initiation. To investigate resistome development, the authors functionally selected resistance to 16 antibiotics from 21 faecal metagenomic expression libraries. Of the 794 AR genes identified, 79% had not previously been classified as AR genes.  Deep shotgun sequencing of all stools revealed that multidrug-resistant members of the genera Escherichia, Klebsiella and Enterobacter, genera commonly associated with nosocomial infections dominate the preterm infant gut microbiota. AR genes that are enriched following specific antibiotic treatments are generally unique to the specific treatment and are highly correlated with the abundance of a single species. The most notable exceptions include ticarcillin-clavulanate and ampicillin, both of which enrich for a large number of overlapping AR genes, and are correlated with Klebsiella pneumoniae. All antibiotic treatments are associated with widespread collateral microbiome impact by enrichment of AR genes that have no known activity against the specific antibiotic driver.",

      "description": "<b>Background:</b> Childhood growth and thriving remain sub-optimal in low-resource settings worldwide, underscoring the need to better understand underlying etiologies and to identify interventions toward improving outcomes. Children living in the area around Haydom, Tanzania were found in the MAL-ED study to have a high burden of infection with intestinal pathogens starting early in life. High carriage of enteropathogens, even in the absence of diarrhea, was associated with a 1.36 increased odds of having lower length for age. A prior meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials reported that childhood antibiotic use was associated with a 0.04 cm/month increase in height.\n      <p />\n      Another potential means of improving growth is by targeting the tryptophan-kynurenine-niacin pathway, in which dietary tryptophan is absorbed and then metabolized by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) to kynurenine and later to nicotinic acid, a key precursor to NAD+. In MAL-ED, children at the Haydom site with higher ratios of kynurenine:tryptophan were noted to have poorer linear growth.  Children in the Haydom area have a maize-based diet low in tryptophan, a key precursor to niacin/nicotinamide and NAD+.\n      <p />\n      We hypothesized that among children with a high degree of stunting and enteric pathogen burden in this region, intervention with 1) antimicrobials and/or 2) nicotinamide would increase linear growth.  We further set out to interrogate the potential mechanisms behind these effects. In the case of antimicrobial intervention, we hypothesize that intervention with azithromycin and nitazoxanide (relative to placebo) would result in a decrease in enteropathogen burden that would be associated with an increase in growth. In the case of nicotinamide (relative to placebo), we hypothesize that intervention will result in a reduction in the kynurenine:tryptophan ratio, an increase in availability of nicotinamide for NAD+ synthesis and associated increases in growth.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objectives:</b> The primary objectives of this randomized factorial, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial are to determine if interventions with 1) antimicrobials and 2) nicotinamide are associated with increased length-for-age z-score (LAZ, relative to placebo-treated children) by age 18 months.\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology:</b> \n      <blockquote>\n        <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> Area around Haydom, Tanzania (a rural, semi-arid area with a high degree of poverty)\n        <p />\n        <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> September 2017 - March 2020\n        <p />\n        <b>Study Design:</b> Factorial randomized controlled trial with treatment between 2 weeks and 18 months of age \n        <p />\n        <b>Eligibility Criteria:</b> The participants must have met the following\n        <blockquote>\n          <p />\n          <b><i>Inclusion criteria:</i></b>\n          <ul>\n            <li>Mother is >18 years</li>\n            <li>Child is age <14 days</li>\n            <li>Born in the Haydom catchment area (defined for study purposes as 25 km radius of Haydom Lutheran Hospital)</li>\n          </ul>\n          <b><i>Exclusion criteria:</i></b>\n          <p />\n          <ul>\n            <li>Maternal inability to adhere to the protocol</li>\n            <li>Multiple gestation</li>\n            <li>Significant birth defect or neonatal illness</li>\n            <li>Weight <1,500 g at enrollment (age < 14 days)</li>\n            <li>Lack of intent to breastfeed infant </li>\n            <li>Plan to move from area within the next 18 months</li>\n          </ul>\n        </blockquote>\n        <p />\n        <b>Study Arms:</b> The nicotinamide intervention consists of nicotinamide 250 mg daily administered by mouth to the child's mother during breast feeding 0-6 months (and thus passed on to the child via breast milk) and then 100 mg administered daily by mouth to the child during months 6-18.\n        <p />\n        The antimicrobial intervention consis",

An estimated 800 million people are at risk of infection and more than 200 million people are infected globally. \n     <p />\n     The standard test for <i>S. mansoni</i> involves duplicate Kato-Katz thick smear examination (two slides of a single stool specimen) from school-age children to estimate local infection prevalence and to map areas for MDA intervention. While essentially 100% specific, the Kato-Katz method has several limitations, including lack of sensitivity in areas of low prevalence and intensity, inconvenience of collecting stool samples, and the need for microscopy equipment and highly trained technicians. As an alternative to the stool exam, a new point-of-care (POC) lateral flow cassette assay that diagnoses <i>Schistosoma mansoni</i> infection by detection of parasite circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in patient urine is commercially available, known to be reliable and effective, and could potentially replace traditional Kato-Katz stool examination for the mapping of areas at risk for intestinal schistosomiasis. \n     <p />\n     <b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the utility of the POC-CCA assay, the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) funded investigators in five African countries for a harmonized multi-center evaluation of this POC-CCA assay's performance among school-age children in areas anticipated to have high, medium, or low prevalence and intensity of <i>S. mansoni</i> infection. Targeted study areas also included some areas with mixed <i>S. mansoni</i> and <i>S. haematobium</i> infection. For further comparison, school-age children were also tested from an area in Ethiopia that was endemic for soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), but believed to be non-endemic for <i>S. mansoni</i>.\n     <p />\n     <b>Methodology:</b>\n     <blockquote>\n     <b>Study Sites:</b> Cameroon, Côte d'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda\n     <p />\n     <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> 2012\n     <p />\n     <b>Study Design:</b> Cross-sectional survey\n     <p/>\n     <b>Data Collection:</b> In the selected villages, investigators tested as many 9- to 12-year-old children as possible in local school classes.

This field and laboratory assay detects parasite eggs to estimate prevalence and intensity of infection and ultimately determines the treatment strategy of a program. The KK test requires the collection of stool and, although considered highly specific, is known to be relatively insensitive, especially in areas with low prevalence and intensity. Recently, the development and evaluation of a urine-based, field-friendly, point of contact assay that detects worm-produced circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) has shown to be relatively specific and highly sensitive across endemic settings. It is particularly valuable for national programs to evaluate the burden of <i>S. mansoni</i> where regular preventive chemotherapy with praziquantel has been ongoing and there is, consequently, lower endemicity and where program goals may change to elimination as a public health problem.\n      <p />\n      In 2007, mapping of neglected tropical diseases in Burundi found that several of its regions were at risk of schistosomiasis and that <i>S. mansoni</i> was the only human schistosome species that was endemic. A national NTD control program was rolled out in which annual mass drug administration (MDA) of praziquantel targeted school-age children. In 2014, after 6 years of praziquantel annual mass distribution in targeted areas, and sentinel site monitoring data that indicated a decline in prevalence of infection, the national burden of schistosomiasis was reassessed to determine the feasibility of moving toward elimination of <i>S. mansoni</i> in Burundi.\n      <p />\n      <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this study was to assess the geographical distribution of <i>S. mansoni</i> using a urine-based CCA rapid cassette assay to test a selection of school-age children, complemented by KK stool assays performed in a subset of schools, to determine the feasibility of moving toward schistosomiasis elimination in Burundi.\n      <p />\n      <b>Methodology</b>\n      <blockquote>\n      <b>Geographic Location/Study Sites:</b> This study was conducted throughout Burundi.\n      <p />\n      <b>Dates of Data Collection:</b> May 2014\n      <p />\n      <b>Study Design:</b> Cross-sectional study.\n      <p />\n      <b>Sampling:</b> A multistage, cross-sectional, cluster-randomized survey was undertaken.
