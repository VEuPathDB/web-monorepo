 * A utility to make a reducer collection-oriented. I.e., the resulting state
 * is indexed by some identifier derived from an `Action`. This utility reduces
 * boilerplate and manages immutable updates to the state.
 * 
 * Enhances a reducer by returning a parent state object that is keyed by an
 * index value. Actions are delegated to the provided reducer, using the return
 * value of `getIndexValue(action)` as the index value. If
 * `getIndexValue(action)` returns `undefined`, the reducer will be called with
 * it and all substates.
