This track shows <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11932250">BLAT</a> alignment of consensus transcript sequences (DTs) to the genome. DTs are generated by clustering ESTs based on BLAT alignment to the genome followed by <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10508846"> CAP4</a> assembly.
