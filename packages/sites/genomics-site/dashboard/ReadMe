/dashboard is a web interface that provides state information for a EuPathDB website,
including data from Apache HTTP Server, Tomcat and the WDK.

/dashboard is written in PHP. The Tomcat and WDK information is obtained from JMX mbeans
via Jolokia's JMX-HTTP bridge. Apache server information is obtained directly from
PHP's libraries.


Requirements for /dashboard

  - Jolokia JMX-HTTP bridge deployed in the same Tomcat instance as the webapp hosting /dashboard.

  - Apache HTTP server configuration must export environment variables for TOMCAT_INSTANCE and CONTEXT_PATH [1].
    e.g.
      SetEnv TOMCAT_INSTANCE Test
      SetEnv CONTEXT_PATH /cryptodb.msh

  - http ports configured in workers.properties file [2]. e.g.
    custom.TonkaDB.http_port=8500

  - Add directives for /dashboard In Apache virtual host configuration [3]. e.g.
      Alias /dashboard /var/www/mheiges.cryptodb.org/dashboard
      <Directory "/var/www/mheiges.cryptodb.org/dashboard">
        AllowOverride AuthConfig FileInfo Indexes Limit Options=All,MultiViews
        Options +MultiViews
      </Directory>

  - PHP 5
    - PECL json PHP module (available in the RPM php-pecl-json)

Development

A php module (dashboard/lib/modules) is a class that fetches data from some source (e.g. a JMX
bridge or Apache environment) and coalesces the data into a format that can be consumed by a
View (dashboard/view). The module implements to_xml() and to_json() methods.




Footnotes

[1]. /dashboard will use these to look up localhost port for Jolokia. The names of these variables are
defined in /dashboard's php.config
    worker_env_var_name=TOMCAT_INSTANCE
    ctx_path_env_var_name=CONTEXT_PATH
properties, respectively.

Specifically, /dashboard uses Apache's TOMCAT_INSTANCE environment variable to look up the http port in the
workers.properties file. For example, if the instance is TonkaDB, /dashboard looks for
custom.TonkaDB.http_port in the workers.properties file.

/dashboard uses the CONTEXT_PATH environment variable as the context value in the object name in its JMX request.
    org.apidb:component=WDK,subcom=Databases,module=UserDB,path=//localhost/cryptodb.msh


[2].  This is a custom configuration for /dashboard. The property name is defined in /dashboard's php.config
using the worker_properties_http_var_tmpl property.

[3]. The /dashboard web interface is outside the normal html directory so requires explicit configuration
to install and grant access to it. This is intentional so it doesn't accidentally expose site internals.

The MultiViews option in the Apache vitual host configuration allows urls like /dashboard/xml to work
without the .php extension.
