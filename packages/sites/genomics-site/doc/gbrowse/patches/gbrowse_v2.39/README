noninteractive_install.patch - remove interactive prompts from the installation
               code, and remove apache configuration.

umask.patch - set umask in gbrowse so temp files are world writable and
              therefore deletable by eupath staff.

cookie.patch - changes the name of the state cookie from gbrowse_sess to
               gbrowse2_sess to avoid conflict with gbrowse_sess cookies
               web client may have from gbrowse 1.x. The gbrowse 1 
               cookie is good for about 1 year on our sites so this patch
               can be discontinued a year after we release gbrowse 2
