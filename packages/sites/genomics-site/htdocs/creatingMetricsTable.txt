  ApiDB reviewed
       simple knowlege of what crypto has reviewed ... will need to do something different later

  Community entries
     keyword query with "a" as input.  Also queried comments.comments directily for count(distinct source_id)

  Orthologs
     toxo:  select count(*) from apidb.phylogeneticprofile

     plasmo:  select substr(source_id,0,2),count(*)
              from plasmodb.phylogeneticprofile
              group by substr(source_id,0,2);

     crypto:  select substr(source_id,0,2),count(*)
              from apidb.phylogeneticprofile
              group by substr(source_id,0,2);

  GO terms
     toxo:  select count(distinct row_id)

                    from dots.goassociation ga, dots.translatedaasequence s

  EC numbers
     plasmo/crypto:  select substr(source_id,0,2),count(*)
                     from (select distinct s.source_id
                           from dots.aaSequenceEnzymeClass e, dots.aasequence s
                           where s.aa_sequence_id = e.aa_sequence_id)

     toxo:  select count(distinct aa_sequence_id)
            from dots.aaSequenceEnzymeClass;

  SNPs
     toxo/plasmo:  select count(distinct gf.source_id)
                   from dots.snpfeature sf, dots.genefeature gf
                   where sf.parent_id = gf.na_feature_id;

  Expression:   for total union the results for the following queries

  Microarray
      toxo:  select distinct gf.source_id 
             from rad.COMPOSITEELEMENTNASEQUENCE c, dots.transcript t, dots.GENEFEATURE gf
             where c.na_sequence_id = t.na_sequence_id
             and gf.na_feature_id = t.parent_id;

      plasmo:  select substr(source_id,0,2),count(*)
               from (select distinct gf.source_id 
                     from rad.COMPOSITEELEMENTNASEQUENCE c, dots.transcript t, dots.GENEFEATURE gf
                     where c.na_sequence_id = t.na_sequence_id
                     and gf.na_feature_id = t.parent_id)
               group by substr(source_id,0,2);
      NOTE: got slightly more for berghei if went to website and unioned the two available queries with least stringent params.

      BETTER way to do it ... although clumsy ... do the following queries then do id queries with results in website
             then intersect with species queries (pb and pf) and union the results for each species

      select distinct gf.source_id
      from apidb.profile p, dots.genefeature gf
      where gf.na_feature_id = p.subject_row_id;

      select distinct gf.source_id 
      from rad.COMPOSITEELEMENTNASEQUENCE c, dots.transcript t, dots.GENEFEATURE gf
      where c.na_sequence_id = t.na_sequence_id
      and gf.na_feature_id = t.parent_id;

  ESTs
     websites genesbyestoverlap default params with all libs selected except bases overlap set to 10.

  SAGE tags
     queried plasmo4.4.  1 tag and 200 bp from gene.

  Proteomics
     websites with least stringent params...
