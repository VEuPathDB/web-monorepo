<p><span class=title>1. Overview</span>

<p>Gene models whose pair-wise alignments show frameshift or in-frame stops relative to known genes are evaluated to allow detection and repair of any sequencing errors, or annotation of identified mutations.

<p><span class=title>2. Procedure</span>

<p>This document is a guide to edit Cryptosporidium parvum frameshift.</p>

<div class=subtitle>

<span class=subtitle>2.1. Identify and Evaluate Frameshift</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>

The pair-wise alignments of all gene models are checked for potential frameshifts and in-frame stops. All gene identified in this analysis is subjected to review. 

</div>

<span class=subtitle>2.2. Sequence and Assembly Verification</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>

If the bulk of the alignments is suggestive of a frameshift, in-frame stop or sequence ambiguity, the sequence around this region is verified. The sequence coverage and quality is checked by examining the underlying chromatograms for sequencing or editing errors. If the region of interest has low sequence coverage (<3X) or the sequence quality if poor, the region should be re-sequenced if possible. If an error has occurred, the assembly is edited and the gene model re-evaluated.

<p>If the region of interest has high sequence coverage and/or good sequencde quality. If the sequence is correct, the curator determines whether any special cased such as programmed frameshift, incorperation of selenocycsteine, or expression of a multi-domain protein as separate proteins explains the apparent frameshift or in-frame stop.

</div>

<span class=subtitle>2.3. Gene Model Edit</span>


<div class=subsubtitle>
The gene model is edited to reflect the findings of the analysis. Frequently a gene with a frameshift or in-frame stop is called by the gene prediction software as two adjacent genes. Surrounding genes are checked to see if two gene models should be merged. Models can be extended to include alignment regions in other frames. Annotation is curated in accordance with the naming convention guideline.

In house scripts were used to process the results and visualize the outputs.
