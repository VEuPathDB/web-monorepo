<p><span class=title>1. Overview</span>

<p>In the initial <i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i> Iowa II genome submission, there were 409 genes not annotated protein coding regions. They apprear as follows in the GenBank record,

<pre class=programinput>
  gene            complement(<12690..>13466)
                  /locus_tag="cgd7_20"
                  /note="introns and exons likely"
  gene            <13964..>21388
                  /locus_tag="cgd7_30"
  CDS             13964..21388 
                  /locus_tag="cgd7_30" 
                  /codon_start=1 
                  /product="large uncharacterized protein" 
                  /protein_id="EAK90507.1" 
                  /db_xref="GI:46229689"
</pre>

The 409 that does not have CDS annotated is due in part to the decision the initial annotation team made and how Genbank wants CDS defined. Most of these genes have good BLAST homology that does not fit neatly into one ORF. The annotation team with the Minnesota project decided not to define gene boundaries as the longest open reading frame (ORF) if a neighboring region contained significant homology suggestive of an exon.  

<p><span class=title>2. Procedure</span>

<p>This document is a guide to predict Cryptosporidium parvum intron.</p>

<div class=subtitle>

<span class=subtitle>2.1. Run BLASTX against NRDB</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>
Nucleotide sequences of those 409 genes, with uncertain boundaries and no CDS features, were extract from the GenBank record. BLASTX 2.0-WashU was used to search for similarities of the 409 <i>C. parvum</i> genes in the Sept. 29, 2005 release of the non-redundant protein database (NRDB).

<p>Parameters used were:

<pre class=programinput>
matrix=BLOSUM62 V=100 B=1000000 -hspmax=1000000 W=4 
T=18 -gi E=1e-3 -wordmask=seg -hspsepQmax=50000 
-span1 -topcomboN=1
</pre>

In house scripts were used to post-process the results by E-value, match length and overlap. The top five best matches were evaluated. If they meet the criteria, their protein sequences will be retrieved from the GenBank. 

<p>The criteria for picking the top best matches were: 1) E-value < 1E-10; 2) very good coverage, match length / nucleotide length is at least over 80%.

</div>

<span class=subtitle>2.2. Run exonerate</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>

Exonerate is a freely available sequence alignment program and developed by Slater and Birney. It introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. It implements heuristics approximating to many complex alignment models. The protein sequences collected from step 2.1 were used as query and nucleotide sequence as target. We used the 'protein2genome' model in the command.  

<p>Parameters used were:

<pre class=programinput>
--exhaustive yes --model protein2genome 
--querytype protein --targettype dna 
--showvulgar yes --gappedextension yes
</pre>

In house scripts were used to process the results and visualize the outputs.

</div>

<span class=subtitle>2.3. Comparative Analysis</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>

Another <i>Cryptosporidium</i> species, <i>C. hominis isolate TU502</i>, had been sequenced. Two species, <i>C. hominis</i> and <i>C. parvum</i>, which differ in host range, genotype and pathogenicity, are most relevant to humans. <i>C. hominis</i> is restricted to humans, whereas <i>C. parvum</i> also infects other mammals. 

<p>
The two species are 95% identical at the nucleotide leve. Comparative analysis of two genomes has been implemented, including searching ortholog groups and identify syntenic regions. The results can be visualized in <a href=/cgi-bin/gbrowse/cryptodb>SynView</a>

</div>

<span class=subtitle>2.4. Evaluate results and make a decision</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>
Check if a neighboring region contains significant homology suggestive of an exon. Evaluate all ORFs longer than 60aa without any annotation in the region; Evaluate the result of Exonerate
</div>


<span class=subtitle>2.5. Adjust the gene boundary to match CDS</span>

<div class=subsubtitle>
Stop the CDS at its stop codon. The gene location needs to be adjusted to the 5' and/or 3' end of CDS. Otherwise, there has to be explanation for why the gene is longer than its CDS.
