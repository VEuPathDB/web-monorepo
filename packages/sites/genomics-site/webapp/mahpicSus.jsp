  <h3>What is MaHPIC?</h3><br>
  <a href="http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu/index.html">MaHPIC</a> is an 
  <a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/">NIAID</a>-funded initiative to characterize host-pathogen interactions during malaria 
  infections of non-human primates. READ MORE
  <a href="#" class="read_more">Read More...</a><br><br>
  
  <span class="more_text">
     MaHPIC's experimental infections are carefully planned and monitored, producing publicly available data sets (clinical and 
     a wide range of omics) that
     address disease progression, recrudescence, relapse, host susceptibility and co-infections. These data sets can be used to 
     develop new diagnostics, drugs and vaccines to reduce the global suffering caused by this disease.<br><br>

    <section>
	The <a href="http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu/index.html">Malaria Host-Pathogen Interaction Center (MaHPIC)</a> was established 
	in September 2012 by the 
	<a href="https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/malaria-host-pathogen-interaction-center-mahpic">National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</a>, 
	part of the US National Institutes of Health. The MaHPIC team uses a "systems biology" strategy to study how malaria parasites 
	interact with their human and other animal hosts to cause disease in molecular detail. The central hypothesis is that 
	"Non-Human Primate host interactions with Plasmodium pathogens as model systems will provide insights into mechanisms, 
	as well as indicators for, human malarial disease conditions".
	<p>
	The MaHPIC effort includes many teams working together to produce and analyze data and metadata.  These teams are briefly described below 
	<a href="http://www.systemsbiology.emory.edu/research/cores/index.html">(detailed information)</a>: 
	
	  <ul>
	   <li>Clinical Malaria - designs and implements experimental plans involving infection of non-human primates</li>
	   <li>Functional Genomics - develops gene expression profiles from blood and bone marrow </li>
	   <li>Proteomics - develops detailed proteomics profiles from blood and bone marrow</li>
	   <li>Lipidomics - investigates lipids and biochemical responses associated with lipids from blood and bone marrow</li> 
	   <li>Immunology - determines immune profiles of peripheral blood and bone marrow in the course of malaria infections of non-human primates. </li>
	   <li>Metabolomics - provides detailed metabolomics data for plasma and associated cellular fractions</li>
	   <li>Bioinformatics - standardizes, warehouses, maps and integrates the data generated by the experimental cores</li>
	   <li>Computational Modeling - integrates the data sets generated by the experimental cores into static and dynamic models.</li>

   <h3>What is the MaHPIC-PlasmoDB Interaction?</h3><br>
   PlasmoDB serves as a gateway for the scientific community to access MaHPIC data. READ MORE<br><br>

   The MaHPIC project produces large amounts of data, both clinical and omics.  MaHPIC data is stored in public repositories whenever possible 
   (e.g. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">NCBI's Sequence Read Archive</a> for RNA Sequencing). When an appropriate public 
   repository does not exist (e.g. clinical data and metadata), PlasmoDB stores the data in our Download Section.  The Access Data section 
   of this page provides links to all available MaHPIC data. <br><br>
   
   As part of the MaHPIC’s data deposition effort, data sets composed of experimental results from the Clinical Malaria team are 
   hosted at PlasmoDB and HostDB.  Results include a rich collection of data and metadata collected over the course of 
   individual MaHPIC experiments. Each ‘data set’ consists of a set of files, including a descriptive README, that contain clinical, 
   veterinary, and animal husbandry results from a MaHPIC Experiment.  The results produced by the MaHPIC Clinical Malaria Team are the 
   backbone of MaHPIC experiments.<br><br>
   
  
  <h3> MaHPIC Experimental Design </h3>
    
	
	<section>
	The MaHPIC strategy is to collect physical specimens from non-human primates (NHPs) over the course of an experiment.  Experiments are usually 
	planned for 100 day periods.  In addition to uninfected control experiments, NHPs are infected with Plasmodium parasites and physical samples 
	are collected either daily or at specific time points, depending on the specimen type (blood, bone marrow, etc) as the infection progresses.  
	Samples are then analyzed by the MaHPIC teams and a diverse set of data and metadata are produced.

	<b>Suggested by Susanne:</b><br>
	MaHPIC experiments are longitudinal studies of Plasmodium infections in non-human primates 
	designed to elucidate host-pathogen interactions. 
    Infected animals and uninfected controls are monitored daily over 100 days for clinical parameters.  
    In addition, blood and bone marrow samples are collected at certain milestones of disease progression, 
    and analyzed with 5 omics technologies by the MaHPIC teams. The experimental strategy produces a diverse set of data and 
	metadata.  The result is a comprehensive array of omics data sets plus clinical data and 
	metadata that are publicly available either at official repositories, here on PlasmoDB or on HostDB.<br><br>

   <h4>Experiment 4</h4>
    <section>
    For MaHPIC Experiment 04, 5 Rhesus macaques (Macacca mulatta) were infected with <i>Plasmodium cynomolgi</i> (B strain) and monitored 
    over a 100-day period. Daily clinical parameters as well as blood bone marrow samples taken at milestones of disease progression 
    were collected.
